# Computer Science Hex Regex Tutorial and functionality 

Hello, I am making this tutorial so that I can hopefully help someone down the road understand the very thing I was confused about. Even though this is a homework assignment I am actually loving the idea that this could help someone else. 


## Summary

I picked the Hex Regex to explain because as I work through this coarse, to no surprise, I am loving the front end aspect of coding. Out of all the options given to choose from for this assignment, matching a Hex value with a regex seemed the most useful for me to know about, especially for the front end aspect of things.

Here is the Regex (Regular Expression) That I will be going in detail about:  

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
