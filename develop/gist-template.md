# Computer Science Hex Regex Tutorial and functionality 

Hello, I am making this tutorial so that I can hopefully help someone down the road understand the very thing I was confused about. Even though this is a homework assignment I am actually loving the idea that this could help someone else. 


## Summary

I picked the Hex Regex to explain because as I work through this coarse, to no surprise, I am loving the front end aspect of coding. Out of all the options given to choose from for this assignment, matching a Hex value with a regex seemed the most useful for me to know about, especially for the front end aspect of things.

Here is the Regex (Regular Expression) That I will be going in detail about:  

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

Everything below goes into and breakers down all the components of a Hex Value Regex. Letâ€™s start with the anchors. 

### Anchors

Anchors of a regex are to show the start and the end of a string, so for example in the hex regex listed above, the anchors would be ^ and $. 

The ^ indicates the start of the string 
The $ indicates the end of the string
Note: The / at the beginning and end of the regex indicate the start and end of the regex, not the string.
